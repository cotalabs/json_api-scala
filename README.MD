JSON:API for Scala
==================

Current Version: **0.0.1**

This is a small library providing a memory model for [{json:api}](http://jsonapi.org/) .

Supported Integrations:

* [Circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/)

This was inspired by [scala-jsonapi](https://github.com/zalando/scala-jsonapi).
A desire for a wee bit more type safety and
an ability to use the integrated JSON library's representation
for the free-form JSON making up _attributes_ and _meta_
was the impetus to make a separate implementation.

It is currently in a sufficiently usable state for me and
I will likely only be making changes as I personally find necessary.
However, I am happy to receive suggestions or contributions!
